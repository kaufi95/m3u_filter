# m3u_filter

This simple python script takes an .m3u file as input. The file is filtered by the specified patterns (include and exclude pattern). Afterwards the pattern names will be removed from the channel names. Finally the result will be sorted and written into a new .m3u file (output).

Main purpose of the script is to filter .m3u lists by location reference.
