# m3u_filter

This python script takes an .m3u file as input. The file is filtered by the specified patterns (filters). Afterwards the result will be written into a new .m3u file (output).

The output file is renamed to the current date and the filter-patterns that were used during processing.

Main purpose of the script is to filter .m3u lists by location reference.
